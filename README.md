## AoC Solutions

The collection of my advent of code solutions. 
My first year was 2023, but I found it was a great way 
to force yourself to get familiar with the syntax and 
features of a new language. I used it to learn lua.  
I suppose you can learn lua in like 15 minutes, but still 
it was a really nice experience for building familiarity 
with the syntax.  This year, I decided I wanted to learn
Lisp.  Just to learn something really different from what
I am familiar with.  As such, I did 2021 in 
common lisp.
