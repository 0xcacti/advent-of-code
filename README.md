## AoC Solutions

The collection of my advent of code solutions. 
My first year was 2023, but I found it was a great way 
to force yourself to get familiar with the syntax and 
features of a new language. I used it to learn lua.  
I suppose you can learn lua in like 15 minutes, but still 
it was a really nice experience for building familiarity 
with the syntax.  This year, I decided I wanted to learn
Lisp.  Just to learn something really different from what
I am familiar with.  As such, I did 2021 in common lisp.  
Boom, 2025 it's C time. I really like C and advent of code 
is really making me appreciate it even more.  I've been having to think 
a lot about my allocations during these problems.  It's 
made them a whole new level of difficult.
